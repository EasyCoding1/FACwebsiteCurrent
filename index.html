            <p id="quoteBox"><em><strong>My path towards applying for Founders and Coders has been quite an adventure</strong>. After dropping out of university, unsure of what to do I left to teach in China for a year. I wanted to see some of the world and learn about different cultures and lives outside of the one I had seen so far.I had lots of fun and learned even more, but unfortunately my 2 year plan was cut short when Covid hit and I had to literally drop everything and leave. I returned to the UK and started working in sales. It was around this time that I was diagnosed with ADHD. The diagnosis and subsequent treatment led me to reevaluate my goals and ambitions, which ultimately inspired me to create EduBridge Tutoring.

                <p>EduBridge Tutoring is an online tutoring agency that focuses on offering quality education at affordable prices, aiming to make learning more accessible to everyone. When it came to building the tech infrastructure for the business, I quickly realised that hiring contractors would be quite expensive. This prompted me to learn basic HTML and CSS, and I soon discovered a genuine passion for coding.</p>
    
                <p>The more I delved into coding, the more I became interested in the tech industry. I wanted to continue my involvement with EduBridge Tutoring, but also explore the world of coding further. That's when I came across Founders and Coders. <strong>Their free, cooperative learning approach and emphasis on real-world projects really resonated with me, as it perfectly aligns with my values and desire to make education accessible.</strong></p>
                
                <p>The fact that Founders and Coders offers their course for free means I can maintain my commitment to EduBridge Tutoring while simultaneously learning to code. This wouldn't have been possible if I had to take on another job to support myself during my coding journey. I'm truly excited to see where this new chapter with Founders and Coders will take me, as I continue to learn, grow, and make a positive impact in the field of education.</p>

      <h2>My First Cooking Website</h2>
      <img src="../FACwebsiteCurrent/images.png/hobbypage1.png" alt="Cooking Website Screenshot" class="website-image" />
      <p>
        I built this website as I have recently been learning cooking. It was the first website I ever created, and it served as a great chance to learn and practice HTML and CSS. Getting started I followed the start of the curriculums from <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank">FreeCodeCamp</a> and <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/" target="_blank">The Odin Project</a> to acquire the necessary skills to bring my cooking hobby to life online.
      </p>
      <p>
        After completing the website, I felt proud of my progress and accomplishments. I had to come back quite a bit later to add JavaScript to display the  date, showcasing my new skills in web development.
      </p>
      <p>
        This website stands as a testament to the start of my learning coding journey and dedication to web development, and its simple, fun project that I hope to come back to when I am further down the road to update.

      <h2>Rock, Paper, Scissors Game</h2>
      <img src="../FACwebsiteCurrent/images.png/RPS.png" alt="Rock, Paper, Scissors Game Screenshot" class="game-image" />
      <p>
        For this project, I developed a Rock, Paper, Scissors game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The initial version of the game was designed to work solely in the console, focusing on the underlying game logic. This approach allowed me to concentrate on perfecting the core gameplay mechanics before moving on to the user interface.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once the console-based game was completed, I returned to the project to design and implement a user-friendly interface. This process was challenging, as it required me to integrate the JavaScript logic with the HTML and CSS elements. Although it took me a while, I am satisfied with the final result. I believe that the game's appearance and usability could be further improved with more experience and practice.
      </p>
      <p>
        To make is a little more fun and interesting I swapped out Rock, Paper and Scissors for Earth, Wind and Fire and set the page up to play the song of the same name.
