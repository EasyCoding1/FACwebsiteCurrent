This is the correct application website

Had to move the file as I had issues with git commits, so I have replaced old Repo with this one and moved everything across and deleted old repo. Hopefully this doesnt mess anything up lol.

Most of the HTML and basic CSS is done, and now need to add functionality to the page.





Spent about 2 hours making the buttons for my gallery work but seem to have that done and working now. Was very tricky getting images to fit the buttons, but found I could just set a background image to the buttons instead of putting an image div within the button, much better all around.


Added modal to the buttons which pops up when clicked. Can use this section as the project gallery. Ideally clicking will bring up larger image of project than the thumbnail and inlude a better description and a link to the page of the project.
