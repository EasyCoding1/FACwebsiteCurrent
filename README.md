This is the correct application website

Had to move the file as I had issues with git commits, so I have replaced old Repo with this one and moved everything across and deleted old repo. Hopefully this doesnt mess anything up lol.

Most of the HTML and basic CSS is done, and now need to add functionality to the page.
